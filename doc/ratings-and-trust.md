# Ratings and trust

Rein has two systems in place to help users decide with whom to work with and who to avoid.

## Ratings

The first and more simple of the two systems is a five-star rating system. After a job is completed, either through acceptance of the delivery by the client or through successful mediation, all involved users (client, mediator and worker) are given the option to rate the other two participants on a scale from 0 to 5. If a user so desires, he can also leave a comment regarding the other person's performance.

Across the application, these simple five star ratings are used as an indicator of performance by averaging all ratings a user has received and providing the total number of ratings for reference. A user's ratings, comments on his performance and who he has been rated by can be viewed in more detail on their ratings page.

## Trust score

A slightly more sophisticated system allows the user to calculate trust scores for other users on their ratings page. This can be done either automatically, if the user has enabled the setting on his settings page, or manually by clicking a button on an individual ratings page.

The trust score system is based on the idea that you usually don't trust someone you have no connection to. How would you know that their ratings aren't fake? Usually, you seek out clients, workers or mediators based on someone you do know vouching for them.
